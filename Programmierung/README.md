# Arduino Programmierung
The Goal is to build knowledge inside of the Team as well as to provide a basis on which we can rely to assist the students.

## Arduino IDE
- Intro to how to upload a sketch and the buttons
- Intro to the Serial Monitor and how to setup a serial communication 

## How to read Ultrasonic sensor Data
- explain how the sensor works 
- Fritzing schematics
- Code snipets
- display on serial monitor 

## How to use a DC motor controller 
- explain how it works (PWM)
- Explain how to use it with an arduino 
- schematics
- Code snipets to test the motors

## How to use a servo motor
- Explain how it works
- Explain how to use it with an arduino 
- schematics
- Code snipets to test the motors

## How to use functions (optional)
- How to define them 
- How it helps make your code more readable and lighter

## How to avoid obstacles
- ratio distance speed of the car 
- Reaction Time 


# Ultraschall-Sensor
$$\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v~dx = \int_\Omega fv~dx$$
